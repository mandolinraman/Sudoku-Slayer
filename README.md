# Sudoku-Slayer: Sudoku solver based on a message passing algorithm

My goal was to try to write a sudoku solver based only on "reasoning", i.e. by using a message passing algorithm to iteratively eliminate or limit choices in each cell. It can't solve some "hard" puzzles yet.

The algorithm does not use substitution and backtracking unlike many other solvers.
